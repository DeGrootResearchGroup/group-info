# Conference Policies

- The reasons that students are sent to conferences include: practicing presentation skills, networking, observing good/bad presentation styles, learning more about the broader field, etc. It is not just about presenting your paper.
- When you go to a conference, you are expected to actively engage in the event. This includes attending a minumum of 70% of the scheduled program time. It is acceptable to take time away from the conference for social reasons, but you should be attending the conference most of the time.
- If you wish to spend more time in the city where the conferences is located, you are free to extend your stay (either before or after) at your own expense. If you choose to travel to other locations on your way to or on the way back from conferences, University policies will still allow for reimbursement of travel, as long as the cost is not more than the direct travel to the conference location.
